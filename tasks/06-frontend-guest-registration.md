# Task: Frontend Guest Registration System

**Priority:** Critical  
**Category:** Frontend Development & User Experience  
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 days

## Overview

Create the frontend components for the guest registration system, including dynamic form rendering, virtual scrolling guest management, and field analytics visualization.

## Prerequisites

- Backend guest registration system is implemented and working
- API endpoints are available and tested
- React Query hooks are generated
- Virtual scrolling libraries are selected (react-window or react-virtualized)

## Tasks

### 1. Dynamic Registration Form

- [ ] Fix TODO in FormBlock.tsx - extract fields from conference.form
- [ ] Create dynamic form renderer supporting all field types
- [ ] Add client-side validation matching backend rules
- [ ] Implement conditional field logic
- [ ] Add progress indicators for multi-section forms
- [ ] Create success/confirmation pages
- [ ] Support file uploads with progress
- [ ] Check browser console during form submission

### 2. Guest Management Dashboard with Virtual Scrolling

**CRITICAL: Must handle thousands of guests efficiently**

- [ ] **Implement Virtual Infinite Scrolling**
  - [ ] Use react-window or react-virtualized for list virtualization
  - [ ] Render only visible rows + buffer
  - [ ] Implement smooth scrolling with dynamic row heights
  - [ ] Add loading indicators during data fetch
  - [ ] Handle scroll position restoration
  - [ ] Test with 10,000+ guest records
- [ ] **Performance Optimizations**
  - [ ] Implement request debouncing for scroll events
  - [ ] Add data prefetching for smoother experience
  - [ ] Use memoization for row components
  - [ ] Optimize re-renders with React.memo
- [ ] Create guest list with dynamic columns
- [ ] Add search across all fields (including custom)
- [ ] Implement advanced filtering UI
- [ ] Add inline editing for quick updates
- [ ] Create bulk actions (export selected, bulk delete)
- [ ] Add import functionality from CSV/Excel
- [ ] Show registration analytics per field
- [ ] Monitor browser performance with DevTools

### 3. Field Analytics Visualization

- [ ] Track completion rates per field
- [ ] Identify drop-off points in forms
- [ ] Analyze field value distributions
- [ ] Create insights on optimal form length
- [ ] Track time spent per field
- [ ] Create analytics dashboard for field performance

### 4. Admin Guest Management Interface

- [ ] Create guest list with dynamic columns
- [ ] Add search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Implement inline editing for quick updates
- [ ] Create bulk operations interface
- [ ] Add import/export functionality
- [ ] Show guest registration analytics

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test dynamic form rendering with all field types
- [ ] Verify client-side validation works correctly
- [ ] Test virtual scrolling with 10,000+ guests
- [ ] Verify smooth scrolling performance
- [ ] Check memory usage doesn't grow with scrolling
- [ ] Test scroll position restoration after navigation
- [ ] Check browser logs during registration
- [ ] Monitor browser Performance tab during scrolling
- [ ] Test form submission with all field types
- [ ] Verify file upload functionality

## Success Criteria

- Dynamic forms render correctly with all field types
- Virtual scrolling handles 10,000+ guests smoothly
- Memory usage remains constant during scrolling
- Initial load time < 2 seconds for large lists
- Form validation works seamlessly
- Guest management interface is intuitive
- Performance remains excellent with large datasets

## Notes

- Use React Query for data fetching
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Add loading states for all async operations
- Consider implementing progressive loading
- Test with actual backend data
- Monitor browser console for form errors
- Check Performance tab for scroll jank
