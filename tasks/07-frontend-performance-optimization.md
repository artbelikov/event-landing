# Task: Frontend Performance Optimization

**Priority:** Important  
**Category:** Frontend Development & Performance  
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 days

## Overview

Optimize frontend performance to ensure fast loading times, smooth interactions, and excellent user experience across all devices and network conditions.

## Prerequisites

- Core functionality is implemented and working
- Performance baseline is established
- Performance monitoring tools are set up
- Virtual scrolling libraries are selected

## Tasks

### 1. Frontend Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement code splitting strategies
- [ ] Add route-based lazy loading
- [ ] Optimize bundle sizes
- [ ] Implement tree shaking
- [ ] Add resource hints (preload, prefetch)
- [ ] Optimize Critical Rendering Path

### 2. Image Optimization

- [ ] Implement responsive images
- [ ] Add WebP format support
- [ ] Create image lazy loading
- [ ] Implement progressive JPEGs
- [ ] Add image CDN integration
- [ ] Create blur-up placeholders

### 3. Frontend Caching Strategy

- [ ] Implement browser caching headers
- [ ] Add service worker caching
- [ ] Create client-side caching strategies
- [ ] Add CDN caching rules
- [ ] Create cache invalidation strategy

### 4. Virtual Scrolling Implementation

- [ ] **Implement Virtual Scrolling Throughout**
  - [ ] Guest lists (already in task 06)
  - [ ] Conference lists
  - [ ] User management lists
  - [ ] Any list with potential for 100+ items
  - [ ] Use consistent virtual scrolling library
  - [ ] Share virtualization components
- [ ] **Monitor Virtual Scrolling Performance**
  - [ ] Track scroll FPS
  - [ ] Monitor memory usage during scrolling
  - [ ] Measure time to render new items

### 5. React Performance Optimization

- [ ] Minimize render-blocking resources
- [ ] Optimize CSS delivery
- [ ] Add debouncing/throttling
- [ ] Optimize React re-renders
- [ ] Implement React.memo strategically
- [ ] Use useMemo for expensive computations
- [ ] Check browser performance tab

### 6. Frontend Monitoring and Metrics

- [ ] Add Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- [ ] Create performance dashboards
- [ ] Track Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Monitor virtual scrolling performance
- [ ] Set up frontend error tracking

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run Lighthouse audits
- [ ] Test with slow network conditions
- [ ] Verify caching works correctly
- [ ] Check Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- [ ] Test on low-end devices
- [ ] Monitor memory usage
- [ ] Check browser DevTools Performance
- [ ] Verify lazy loading works
- [ ] Test virtual scrolling with 10,000+ items
- [ ] Verify no scroll jank at 60 FPS
- [ ] Test on mobile devices with touch scrolling

## Success Criteria

- Page load time < 3 seconds
- Time to Interactive < 5 seconds
- 90+ Lighthouse performance score
- Smooth scrolling and interactions
- Virtual lists handle 10,000+ items smoothly
- Constant memory usage during infinite scroll
- 60 FPS scrolling on mid-range devices

## Notes

- Measure before and after changes
- Focus on perceived performance
- Consider progressive enhancement
- Virtual scrolling is critical for large datasets
- Profile with Chrome DevTools regularly
- Check browser network logs regularly
